# Measles-seroconversion
This repository contains the data and code used to produce the results presented in "RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF INFECTION, ROUTINE VACCINATION AND SUPLEMENTARY IMMUNISATION ACTIVITIES TO MEASLES SEROCONVERSION IN KENYAN CHILDREN - A MODELLING STUDY".
The main model presented in the paper is Main model.R while the model ODE functions and likelihood are in modelfunctions.R.
The other scripts include calculation of Relative Contribution to seroconversion in the baseline,projection scenarios(RC-baseline&projections)
and sensitivity analysis(RC-sensitivityanalysis).
We have also included scripts used to generate the figures in main text and supplementary section
